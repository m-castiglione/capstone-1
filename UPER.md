* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
This is a big project and I to start planning for it, I wrote a bunch of notes and drew sketches on my notepad next to my computer.
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
My main plan consisted of delving into videos and documentation.
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
It was long, but executing the plan gave me no blockers.
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
This project was a toughie but I am glad I learned a lot about react.
